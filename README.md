### OBE:
  1. Outcome-based education (OBE)  is an educational theory that bases each part of an educational system around                goals(outcomes).
  2. By the end of educational experience, each student should have achieved the goal. 
  3. Outcome based learning defines objectives.
  4. **Using Bloom’s Taxonomy**:<br />
     Bloom’s Taxonomy is a classification of the different objectives and skills that educators set for their students                (learning objectives).<br />
    These 6 levels can be used to structure the learning objectives, lessons, and assessments of your course:<br />     
     **1. Remembering**: Recognizing and recalling facts.<br />
     **2. Understanding**: Understanding what the facts mean.<br />
     **3. Applying**: Applying the facts, rules, concepts, and ideas.<br />
     **4. Analyzing**: Breaking down information into component parts.<br />
     **5. Evaluating**: Judging the value of information or ideas.<br />
     **6. Creating**: Combining parts to make a new whole.<br />

## 27-02-2020 Thursday
I have prepared the synopsis of  Outcome based Education System
###  **Keypoints of Synopsis**:
- INTRODUCTION:
Outcome-based education (OBE) is an approach to education in which decisions about the curriculum are driven by the exit learning outcomes (LO) that the students should display at the end of the course. LO as being something that student can do now that they could not do previously’ are changes in people as a result of learning experience.
- OBJECTIVES
1. To increase the knowledge and skills of the learners.
2. It will automate the system and save the time and efforts of the teachers in  making question papers.
3. It will stop repetition of question papers.
- FEASIBILITY STUDY
- LITERATURE REVIEW
- METHODOLOGY & PROBLEM FORMULATION:
The LoQET’s main fuctional  requirements are illustrated in a use case Diagram. The use case diagram shows the actors (I.e Lecturer and e-SMP) that interact with LoQET functionalities. The e-SMP will provide input regarding on course teaching plan and course assessment percentage entries. This input will be informed to the lecturer when she / he wants to compose a question paper for the particular course. Lecturer should also able to export question paper, reset or reorganize the question paper and view question paper. Other basic and common functionalities, such as create, retrieve,update, and delete are also offered.

- LoQET’s component diagram:
1. LoQETui=This component should provide a user- friendly user interface design for lecturers.
2. ComponentQues=The component should provide a main feature of LoQET to compose a set of question, which aligns with learning outcomes and program outcomes. The feature includes creating, deleting or editing these questions.
3. ManagePaper=The component should allow the lecturer to add, delete and edit an examination paper details.
4.ExportPaper=The comnent should allow the lecturer to export composed  exam paper in to several formats such as pdf and txt. 
5.Authorization=The component should verify the user login.
6.DB=The component should store LoQET data onto tables.

- REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
- FUTURE SCOPE
1. Educators should change or improve their ways of instructing and accessing the learner’s work.
2. Content is integrated and learning is relevant and connected to real- life situations.
3. Learning programmes are seen as guides that allow teachers to be innovative and creative in designing their programmes.

 I have Finished Install the mysql.
# How to mysql install from command line step by step
- Install the MySQL database server package.
You can use the Yum tool to install MySQL on Oracle Linux: sudo yum install mysql-community-server.

- Start the MySQL service:
sudo service mysql start

- Launch the MySQL Command-Line Client:
mysql -u root -p
The -p option is needed only if a root password is defined for MySQL. Enter the password when prompted.

- Create a user (for example, amc2) and a strong password:
mysql> create user 'amc2' identified by 'amc2';

To restrict the access to a machine (for example, to localhost for a user) create the user as follows:

- mysql> create user 'amc2'@'localhost' identified by 'amc2';

Create the database (for example, amc2) and grant all access to the user, for example, amc2 as follows:
- mysql> create database amc2;

- mysql> grant all on amc2.* to 'amc2';

Configure your MySQL installation to handle large BLOB entries, such as MSI binaries. To handle BLOB entries, edit the my.cnf file.
You can find the my.cnf file in one of the following locations:

/etc/my.cnf

/etc/mysql/my.cnf

$MYSQL_HOME/my.cnf

[datadir]/my.cnf

Set the options max_allowed_packet and innodb_log_file-size in the [mysqld] section to the values shown:
[mysqld]
max_allowed_packet=300M
innodb_log_file_size=768M
